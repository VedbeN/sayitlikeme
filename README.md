# sayitlike.me
Are you annoyed by those who can't pronounce your name the way you like it?
Do you get sad when you can't call someone's name with grace? I am. I live
in another country, and both my first name and last name are unfamiliar to
too many that I know. Sayitlike.me is an open source response to that problem.

Login with your twitter account, record your name, and you'll get a personal URL
like this:
http://sayitlike.me/YourTwitterHandle

Now send the link to anyone who has a hard time calling you!
