What?

Sayitlike.me is a website where anyone can record their own name, and share a link to the audio with the world.The links are such that knowing someone's twitter handle, you can hear the audio file at sayitlike.me/TwitterHandle.

Why?
To ease the pain of pronouncing names of new people, with uncommon names. and the way they like it.

How it started?

My family name is not a common one. So it takes some effort for those who need to call me by that name. I feel sorry for putting them go through the learning curve.

But one time that someone was struggling to pronounce my last name, it was on the Change Log podcast, a podcast about software that I love to listen. That time I couldn't ignore the guilt anymore. So I started doing something, and Sayitlike.me is what was possible to do.

It can become a dictionary of names, so that if you know someone's twitter handle, you can find out how that person likes to be called.
