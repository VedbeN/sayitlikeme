    <h1>About</h1>
    <p> I like listenning to podcasts. One of my favorites is <a href="https://changelog.com/" target="_blank"> The Change Log</a>. At each Change Log episode, names of some people and products are broght up, and very often pronouncing them takes some seconds of struggling for the hosts of the show Adam and Jerod. So I thought maybe we can help them!
    </p>
    <p> The idea is simply asking people to login by twitter and <strong>record the pronounciation of their name.</strong>Afterwards others can find the recording, by looking for the twitter handles.</p>
    <p> Sayitlike.me is made availble for free and as an opensource project during my commutes and free time. </p>
