    <h1>Why this?</h1>
    <h4> 1. Uncommon Names </h4>
    <p>
    If you're John Smith, you won't go through much trouble when introducing yourself. I'm not a John, neither a Smith, and and i've been spelling it for people since I was 7, for my teachers, other kids, my coworkers, random people...
</p>
    <h4>2. Loving Podcasts</h4>
    <p> I like listenning to podcasts. One of my favorites is <a href="https://changelog.com/" target="_blank"> The Change Log</a>. At each Change Log episode, names of some people and products are broght up, and very often pronouncing them takes some seconds of struggling for the hosts of the show Adam and Jerod. So I thought maybe we can help them, and myself to ease the pain of pronouncing names a bit.
    </p>
    <h4> Solution </h4>
    <p> The idea is simply asking people to login by twitter and <strong>record the pronounciation of their name.</strong>Afterwards others can find the recording, by looking for the twitter handles.</p>
