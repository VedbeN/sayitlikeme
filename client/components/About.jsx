    <p> I like listenning to podcasts, usually technical ones. One of my favorites is <a href="https://changelog.com/" target="_blank"> The Change Log</a>. At each Change Log episode, names of some people and/or products gets broght up, and very often pronouncing them takes some seconds of struggle for the hosts of the show Adam and Jerod. So I thought maybe we can help them!
